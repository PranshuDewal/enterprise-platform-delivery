# Enterprise Platform Delivery

# Pranshu Mohan Dewal
Technology leader in enterprise delivery, data platforms, and applied AI. I care deeply about building lean systems that work in the real world—under scale, navigating regulation and long-term operational constraints.

This repository documents how I have led and delivered large-scale, data-intensive enterprise platforms in production environments across energy, transportation, and other regulated domains. This repository is intended as a practical reference for teams operating in high-stakes production environments. 

The focus is execution: system design, delivery governance, data integrity, cutover discipline, and post-production stabilization.

All material is abstracted from real enterprise programs, with all client-specific and proprietary details removed.
## What this repository represents
- Multi-application enterprise programs (30+ platforms)
- Data governance, migration, and system integration at scale
- Analytics and AI-assisted optimization applied to delivery execution
- High-availability releases with controlled cutovers and stabilization

## Scope of responsibility
Across the patterns documented here, my role included:
- End-to-end delivery leadership and technical ownership
- Architecture and data design review
- Release and cutover decision authority
- Coaching product owners, analysts, and engineering teams

## Contents
- Reference platform architecture used for modernization programs
- Delivery artifacts used to plan, govern, and execute releases
- Data quality and governance controls applied during migration
- Optimization approaches used to reduce cost, risk, and delivery time
